### UX is part of Web Development 
If you still donÂ´t understand why UX designers should be in your TECH Production team, 
then here it is: 

Because they make the web:
- more beautiful (CSS, visuals)
- less annoying  (HTML, information structure)
- less confusing (UX research)

And they all do it in an "INVISIBLE" way.
The less you notice our job, the better!

Next time you see a UX designer give them a blink.
They help making annoyed web users happy. 

You are welcome!
