### UX is part of Web Development

If you still don´t understand why UX designers should be in your TECH Production team,
then here it is:

Because they make the web:

- more beautiful (CSS, visuals)
- less annoying (HTML, information structure)
- less confusing (UX research)

And they all do it in an "INVISIBLE" way.
The less you notice our job, the better!

Next time you see a UX designer give them a blink.
They help making annoyed web users happy.

You are welcome!
